## Common Files

In order to display properly, our generated HTML pages need artwork,
CSS style files, and a few bits of Javascript.  We could load these
from the web, but that would make offline authoring difficult.
Instead, each lesson's repository is self-contained and has a copy of
all these third party resources, and a way of updating them (and only
them) on demand.
